        <p align="left">Former Uber Engineer chronicled her workplace experiences shortly after leaving Uber's hostile work environment
            for a new company. Susan Fowler published a nearly 3,000-word blog post last Sunday describing a nightmarish workplace
            culture in which male superiors solicited her for sex and human resources officers shrugged off her concerns about sexist
            company. Arianna Huffington, board member of  Uber, is spearheading an investigation into the allegations
            and potential policy changes. More info here:<a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-sexual-harassment_us_58aa37b6e4b045cd34c2e3e6">Uber Investigation</a></p>

            Hinge is testing a personal assistant service called Audrey to help you get more dates
            Posted Jan 27, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) </strong>
            Dating app Hinge just launched a twist on matching that moves away from swiping to “stories,” in order to
            help people more long-terms relationships. This focus on authenticity has led to the company to test a new
            project called Audrey. Audrey is a personal assistant that messages your matches for you and schedules dates.
            It can take time to find a perfect match, filter messages, and begin introductory chats with potential partners.
            It also takes times to determine based on your needs, matches and who's interested in going out versus just
            needing more friends. Audrey streamlines all of these interactions.</p>
