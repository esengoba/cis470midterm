        <p align="left"><strong>By Lynda O'Connor</strong> <br>Former Uber Engineer chronicled her workplace experiences shortly after leaving Uber's hostile work environment
            for a new company. Susan Fowler published a nearly 3,000-word blog post last Sunday describing a nightmarish workplace
            culture in which male superiors solicited her for sex and human resources officers shrugged off her concerns about sexist
            company. Arianna Huffington, board member of  Uber, is spearheading an investigation into the allegations
            and potential policy changes. <br>More info here:<a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-sexual-harassment_us_58aa37b6e4b045cd34c2e3e6">Uber Investigation</a></p>

        <p align="left"> <strong>By Matthew Lynley</strong> <br> Google today said it is acquiring Kaggle, an online service that hosts data science and machine learning competitions.
            Google made the announcement at its Google Cloud Next conference on March 7 in San Francisco. This acquisition would
            allow Google the immediate ability to broaden its influence in the AI community. Recently, Google has been
            facing more competition in the AI space as other competitors are mastering autonomous driving and deep learning.
            Purchasing Kaggle, and its mindshare community, allow Google to improve recruiting efforts with candidates specializing
            in deep learning like Pinterest. <br> More info here:<a href = "https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/google-confirms-its-acquisition-of-data-science-community-kaggle/">Kaggle Acquistion</a></p>

        <p align="left"> <strong> By Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) </strong> <br>
            Dating app Hinge just launched a twist on matching that moves away from swiping to “stories,” in order to
            help people more long-terms relationships. This focus on authenticity has led to the company to test a new
            project called Audrey. Audrey is a personal assistant that messages your matches for you and schedules dates.
            It can take time to find a perfect match, filter messages, and begin introductory chats with potential partners.
            It also takes times to determine based on your needs, matches and who's interested in going out versus just
            needing more friends. Audrey streamlines all of these interactions.

            Fitbit, the former leader of the wearable space, is now focusing on making fitness tracking easier. In order
            to remain competitive, Fitbit is launching new product line to improve users' experience with health monitoring
            by incorporating sleep metrics. The Alta HR wristband is a slim fitness wearable that include a heart
            rate monitor, longer battery lif, and sleep tracking features known as Sleep Stage. The metrics will include
            the frequency of awake time, and time slept and awakened. This new product announcement comes at the end
            of dismal earnings in February. Alta HR will hit retail stores for $149.95 in April.More info here:
